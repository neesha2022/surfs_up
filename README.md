# Purpose:
The assignment was to find temperature trends specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu. This will help to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. For this we delivered the summary statistics for June and December. 

# Results:

![Dece.temp](https://github.com/neesha2022/surfs_up/blob/main/Dec%20temp.png)

Average temp in June is about 75 degrees.
Average temp in Dec is about 71 degrees. 
Temprature variation is more in Dec compared to June which has a more bell curved kind of distribution.

# Summary of Findings
Both June and December offer good weather conditions to open the surf and icecream shop. But I would look into other variables such as the wind conditions, precipation, how big the waves are going to be, etc before deciding on opening the business.
